I am a PhD student in Computer Science Department at Tel-Aviv University, advised by <a href="https://www.mfeldman.sites.tau.ac.il/">Prof. Michal Feldman.</a>

My main interests are subject in the intersection of Economics and Computer Science (AKA EconCS, or AGT), where my main focus is on algorithmic contracts design and fair division.
