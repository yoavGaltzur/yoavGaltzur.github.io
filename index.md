I am a PhD student in the Computer Science Department at Tel Aviv University, where I am advised by <a href="https://www.mfeldman.sites.tau.ac.il/">Prof. Michal Feldman</a>.

My research lies at the intersection of Economics and Computer Science (commonly known as EconCS or Algorithmic Game Theory), with a focus on algorithmic contract design and fair division.

You can find my <a href="/Resume_may_25.pdf">CV here</a> (updated May 2025).
